# TextureArrayMakerTool
Simple easy to use Unity tool to create Texture2DArrays from the inspector

Just copy the code into a script and put the script in the editor folder inside your project. That will create a new tools dropdown at the top of your project that you can use to open up the tool. Select the output settings you want from the drop downs and drag textures into the texture fields. The tool will take care of resizing your textures to the selected resolutions, so do not worry about them being different. When you click save a file diolouge will direct you to save the asset. You have to save the file somewhere in the Asset folder of your project.
